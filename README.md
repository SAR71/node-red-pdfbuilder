## Usage
Instructions of how to describe document you can find at pdfmake website, documentation section.

[pdfmake website doc](https://pdfmake.github.io/docs/0.3/document-definition-object/) 

There is just one node, and it expects an object in ```msg.payload``` with a valid docDefinition like:
``` json
{ 
	"content": [
		"First paragraph",
		"Another paragraph, this time a little bit longer to make sure, this line will be divided into at least two lines"
	]
	
}
```

## List nodes

**pdfbuilder**: Returns pdf document by specified properties

The following properties can be configured in the node editor:
* **Input property:** Define the property of object which will be used for pdf generation.
* **Options:** Table layout properties. Full description can be found at [pdfmake doc, tables page](https://pdfmake.github.io/docs/0.1/document-definition-object/tables/).
* **Output type:** Select the type of generation (Base 64 or Buffer).
* **Output property:** Define the property of object where generated pdf will be saved.

The node returns a ```msg.payload``` holding the created PDF either as a Buffer or a base64 encoded string (as configured in the node).
